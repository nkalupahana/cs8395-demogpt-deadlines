*Made with DemoGPT for Fall 2023 CS 8395-08*

## Introduction
**Have you ever had a big, multi-week project that you knew you had to get done, but didn't have the willpower to start early? Have you ever left a long assignment until the last minute? If so, this project is for you.**

**Deadlines** is a productivity application designed to help you manage your time better, by breaking down your large projects or assignments into smaller, manageable chunks. Just input your assignment description, final deadline, and start date, and we'll take care of the rest. We'll break it up into easily digestible chunks with shorter deadlines to keep your work spread out and your life less stressful.
